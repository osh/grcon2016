\subsection{Submitting Papers}

{\bf Paper Deadline:} The deadline for paper submission to GRCON 2016
is \textbf{July 1, 2016}. 

{\bf Simultaneous Submission:} GRCON papers must not have been previously 
published or under review elsewhere.  Pre-publication to Arxiv is encouraged.

\medskip

Submissions will only be accepted in PDF format.

\subsection{Feedback from Paper Submission}

Acceptance notification will occur within one week of paper submission via email.
Unless otherwise specified, conference abstracts must previously be accepted.

\subsection{Submitting Final Camera-Ready Copy}

The final versions of papers accepted for publication should follow the
same format as initial submissions, but should use the accepted keyword 
for the style package.

Simply change:
$\mathtt{\backslash usepackage\{grcon2016\}}$ to 

$$\mathtt{\backslash usepackage[accepted]\{grcon2016\}}$$

\noindent

Camera-ready copies should have the title of the paper as running head
on each page except the first one.  

\section{Format of the Paper} 
 
All submissions must follow the same format to ensure consistent reproduction
and to let readers more easily find information.

\subsection{Length and Dimensions}

Papers must not exceed eight (8) pages of content, and ten (10) pages including 
acknowledgements and references.

The text of the paper should be formatted in two columns, with an
overall width of 6.75 inches, height of 9.0 inches, and 0.25 inches
between the columns. The left margin should be 0.75 inches and the top
margin 1.0 inch (2.54~cm) and US Letter size.

The paper body should be set in 10~point type with a vertical spacing
of 11~points. Please use Times typeface throughout the text.

\subsection{Title}

The paper title should be set in 14~point bold type and centered
between two horizontal rules that are 1~point thick, with 1.0~inch
between the top rule and the top edge of the page. Capitalize the
first letter of content words and put the rest of the title in lower
case.

\subsection{Author Information for Submission}
\label{author info}

Author information should include full names, institutional affiliation,
and at least city address, as well as email or web addresses.

\subsection{Abstract}

The paper abstract should begin in the left column, 0.4~inches below
the final address. The heading `Abstract' should be centered, bold,
and in 11~point type. The abstract body should use 10~point type, with
a vertical spacing of 11~points, and should be indented 0.25~inches
more than normal on left-hand and right-hand margins. 
\textbf{Keep your abstract brief and self-contained.}

\subsection{Partitioning the Text} 

You should organize your paper into sections and paragraphs to help
readers place a structure on the material and understand its
contributions.

\subsubsection{Sections and Subsections}

Section headings should be numbered, flush left, and set in 11~pt bold
type with the content words capitalized. Leave 0.25~inches of space
before the heading.  Subsection headings should be numbered, flush left, 
10~pt bold type with 0.2~inches of space left.  Subsubsection headings 
should be numbered, flush left, 10~pt with 0.18~inches of space left.

\subsubsection{Paragraphs and Footnotes}

Within each section or subsection, you should further partition the
paper into paragraphs. Do not indent the first line of a given
paragraph, but insert a blank line between succeeding ones.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{gr.png}}
    \caption{GNU Radio Logo}
    \label{grlogo}
  \end{center}
\end{figure} 

\subsection{Figures}
 
You may want to include figures in the paper to help readers visualize
your approach and your results. Such artwork should be centered,
legible, and clearly labeled and explained with captions similar to Figure~\ref{grlogo}.

\subsection{Citations and References} 

Please use APA reference format regardless of your formatter
or word processor. If you rely on the \LaTeX\/ bibliographic 
facility, use the included {\tt natbib.sty} and {\tt grcon2016.bst}.

This template is based off the excellent template for ICML provided
in the work by \cite{langley00}.

\subsection{Software and Data}

We strongly encourage the publication of software and data with the
camera-ready version of the paper whenever appropriate.  This can be
done by including a URL in the camera-ready copy.
